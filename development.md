# Tathya — Development

## Local Development

For local development, run PostgreSQL and Mailcatcher with Docker Compose, and run the FastAPI and Vite development servers locally.

Start the supporting services:

```bash
docker compose up -d db mailcatcher
```

Then, from the `backend` directory, install the dependencies and prepare the database:

```bash
uv sync
uv run bash scripts/prestart.sh
```

Start the FastAPI development server:

```bash
uv run fastapi dev
```

In another terminal, from the project root, install the frontend dependencies and start the Vite development server:

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

Now you can open these URLs:

Frontend development server: <http://localhost:5173>

Backend API: <http://localhost:8000>

Automatic interactive API documentation with Swagger UI: <http://localhost:8000/docs>

Mailcatcher: <http://localhost:1080>

The frontend development server uses the backend at `http://localhost:8000`, as configured in `frontend/.env`.

### Frontend Served by FastAPI

Build the frontend from the `frontend` directory:

```bash
bun run build
```

The build is written to `backend/app/frontend` and served by FastAPI at <http://localhost:8000>. Rebuild the frontend after making frontend changes.

## Full Stack with Docker Compose

To run the backend and built frontend in Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose run --rm backend bash scripts/prestart.sh
docker compose watch
```

Now you can open these URLs:

Application, with the frontend and API served by FastAPI: <http://localhost:8000>

Automatic interactive API documentation with Swagger UI: <http://localhost:8000/docs>

Adminer, database web administration: <http://localhost:8080>

Traefik UI, to see how the routes are being handled by the proxy: <http://localhost:8090>

Mailcatcher: <http://localhost:1080>

Stop a locally running FastAPI server before starting the Compose backend because both use port `8000`.

**Note**: The first time you start the stack, it might take a minute for all the services to be ready. To monitor it, use `docker compose logs`, or `docker compose logs backend` for the backend service.

## Mailcatcher

Mailcatcher captures emails sent during local development instead of delivering them. The local backend connects to it at `localhost:1025`, and the Compose backend connects to the `mailcatcher` service. Captured emails are available at <http://localhost:1080>.

## Docker Compose files and env vars

There is a main `compose.yml` file with all the configurations that apply to the whole stack, it is used automatically by `docker compose`.

And there's also a `compose.override.yml` with overrides for development, for example to mount the source code as a volume. It is used automatically by `docker compose` to apply overrides on top of `compose.yml`.

The `compose.deploy.yml` file contains the deployment-specific settings, including HTTPS and automatic certificate handling. It is explicitly combined with `compose.yml` when deploying the application.

The backend reads local settings from the `.env` file. Docker Compose also uses it for variable interpolation and passes the settings each container needs.

After changing variables, make sure you restart the stack:

```bash
docker compose watch
```

## The .env file

The `.env` file contains the shared local defaults, generated keys, passwords, and other configuration. Its hostnames use `localhost` for processes running on your machine. Docker Compose overrides hostnames such as the database and SMTP server with their Compose service names.

Depending on your workflow, you could want to exclude it from Git, for example if your project is public. In that case, you would have to make sure to set up a way for your CI tools to obtain it while building or deploying your project.

One way to do it could be to add each environment variable to your CI/CD system.

## Pre-commits and code linting

we are using a tool called [prek](https://prek.j178.dev/) (modern alternative to [Pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)) for code linting and formatting.

When you install it, it runs right before making a commit in git. This way it ensures that the code is consistent and formatted even before it is committed.

You can find a file `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with configurations at the root of the project.

#### Install prek to run automatically

`prek` is already part of the dependencies of the project.

After having the `prek` tool installed and available, you need to "install" it in the local repository, so that it runs automatically before each commit.

Using `uv`, you could do it with (make sure you are inside `backend` folder):

```bash
❯ uv run prek install -f
prek installed at `../.git/hooks/pre-commit`
```

The `-f` flag forces the installation, in case there was already a `pre-commit` hook previously installed.

Now whenever you try to commit, e.g. with:

```bash
git commit
```

...prek will run and check and format the code you are about to commit, and will ask you to add that code (stage it) with git again before committing.

Then you can `git add` the modified/fixed files again and now you can commit.

#### Running prek hooks manually

you can also run `prek` manually on all the files, you can do it using `uv` with:

```bash
❯ uv run prek run --all-files
check for added large files..............................................Passed
check toml...............................................................Passed
check yaml...............................................................Passed
fix end of files.........................................................Passed
trim trailing whitespace.................................................Passed
ruff.....................................................................Passed
ruff-format..............................................................Passed
biome check..............................................................Passed
```

## Backend reference

### Requirements

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python package and environment management.

### Local Development

Run the backend locally and connect it to PostgreSQL in Docker Compose.

From the project root, start PostgreSQL and Mailcatcher:

```console
$ docker compose up -d db mailcatcher
```

Then, from `./backend/`, install the dependencies, prepare the database, and start the development server:

```console
$ uv sync
$ uv run bash scripts/prestart.sh
$ uv run fastapi dev
```

The API is available at `http://localhost:8000`, with automatic interactive docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### General Workflow

Run backend commands from `./backend/` with `uv run`. Make sure your editor uses the Python interpreter at `.venv/bin/python` in the project root.

Modify or add SQLModel models for data and SQL tables in `./backend/app/models.py`, API endpoints in `./backend/app/api/`, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) utils in `./backend/app/crud.py`.

### VS Code

There are already configurations in place to run the backend through the VS Code debugger, so that you can use breakpoints, pause and explore variables, etc.

The setup is also already configured so you can run the tests through the VS Code Python tests tab.

### Full Stack with Docker Compose

To run the backend and built frontend in Docker Compose:

```console
$ docker compose run --rm backend bash scripts/prestart.sh
$ docker compose watch
```

The application is available at `http://localhost:8000`.

#### Docker Compose Override

The `compose.override.yml` file contains local settings for published ports, source synchronization, automatic image rebuilds, and backend reloads. Docker Compose applies it automatically when you run `docker compose` without an explicit file list.

To open a shell in the backend container:

```console
$ docker compose exec backend bash
```

### Backend tests

To test the backend from the `backend` directory, run:

```console
$ uv run bash ./scripts/test.sh
```

The tests run with Pytest, modify and add tests to `./backend/tests/`.

If you use GitHub Actions the tests will run automatically.

#### Test running stack

If your stack is already up and you just want to run the tests, you can use:

```bash
docker compose exec backend bash scripts/tests-start.sh
```

That `/app/scripts/tests-start.sh` script just calls `pytest` after making sure that the rest of the stack is running. If you need to pass extra arguments to `pytest`, you can pass them to that command and they will be forwarded.

For example, to stop on first error:

```bash
docker compose exec backend bash scripts/tests-start.sh -x
```

#### Test Coverage

When the tests are run, a file `htmlcov/index.html` is generated, you can open it in your browser to see the coverage of the tests.

### Migrations

Make sure you create a revision of your models and upgrade the database with that revision every time you change them. From the `backend` directory, use `uv` to run Alembic against the PostgreSQL container:

* Alembic is already configured to import your SQLModel models from `./backend/app/models.py`.

* After changing a model (for example, adding a column), create a revision:

```console
$ uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add column last_name to User model"
```

* Commit to the git repository the files generated in the alembic directory.

* After creating the revision, run the migration in the database (this is what will actually change the database):

```console
$ uv run alembic upgrade head
```

If you don't want to use migrations at all, uncomment the lines in the file at `./backend/app/core/db.py` that end in:

```python
SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)
```

and comment the line in the file `scripts/prestart.sh` that contains:

```console
$ alembic upgrade head
```

If you don't want to start with the default models and want to remove them / modify them, from the beginning, without having any previous revision, you can remove the revision files (`.py` Python files) under `./backend/app/alembic/versions/`. And then create a first migration as described above.

### Email Templates

The email templates are written with [React Email](https://react.email) in `./packages/react-email/`. The `emails` directory holds one component per email and the `ui` directory holds the shared components (layout, heading, button, link, callout).

The rendered HTML in `./backend/app/email-templates/` is generated from those components, it is what the application sends, and it shouldn't be edited by hand.

To preview the emails while editing them, start the dev server from the root of the project:

```console
$ bun run email:dev
```

Values coming from the backend are declared as Jinja placeholders in the component props, for example `username = "{{ username }}"`. The context for each email is built in `generate_*_email()` in `./backend/app/utils.py`, so a new placeholder needs to be added there too.

Once you are done, regenerate the templates used by the application:

```console
$ bun run email:export
```


## Frontend reference

The frontend is built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query), [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

### Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) (recommended) or [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### Quick Start

```bash
bun install
bun run dev
```

* Then open your browser at http://localhost:5173/.

Run `uv run bash scripts/prestart.sh` and `uv run fastapi dev` from the `backend` directory, with PostgreSQL running in Docker Compose. See [development.md](development.md) for the complete setup.

To serve the frontend with FastAPI, run `bun run build` from the `frontend` directory and open `http://localhost:8000`.

Check the file `package.json` to see other available options.

### Generate Client

#### Automatically

* From the top level project directory, run the script:

```bash
bash ./scripts/generate-client.sh
```

* Commit the changes.

#### Manually

* Make sure the backend is running.

* Download the OpenAPI JSON file from `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/openapi.json` and copy it to a new file `openapi.json` at the root of the `frontend` directory.

* To generate the frontend client, run:

```bash
bun run generate-client
```

* Commit the changes.

Notice that everytime the backend changes (changing the OpenAPI schema), you should follow these steps again to update the frontend client.

### Using a Remote API

By default, the built frontend uses the same origin as the FastAPI app. If you want to use a remote API while running the Vite development server, you can set the environment variable `VITE_API_URL` to the URL of the remote API. For example, you can set it in the `frontend/.env` file:

```env
VITE_API_URL=https://my-domain.example.com
```

Then, when you run the frontend, it will use that URL as the base URL for the API.

### Code Structure

The frontend code is structured as follows:

* `frontend/src` - The main frontend code.
* `frontend/src/assets` - Static assets.
* `frontend/src/client` - The generated OpenAPI client.
* `frontend/src/components` -  The different components of the frontend.
* `frontend/src/hooks` - Custom hooks.
* `frontend/src/routes` - The different routes of the frontend which include the pages.

### End-to-End Testing with Playwright

The frontend includes initial end-to-end tests using Playwright. To run the tests, you need to have the Docker Compose stack running. Start the stack with the following command:

```bash
docker compose run --rm backend bash scripts/prestart.sh
docker compose up -d --wait backend
```

Then, you can run the tests with the following command:

```bash
bunx playwright test
```

You can also run your tests in UI mode to see the browser and interact with it running:

```bash
bunx playwright test --ui
```

To stop and remove the Docker Compose stack and clean the data created in tests, use the following command:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

To update the tests, navigate to the tests directory and modify the existing test files or add new ones as needed.

For more information on writing and running Playwright tests, refer to the official [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro).
